### **Arrays**

1. Implement a method to find the subarray with the maximum sum (Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm) in a given integer array.
2. Write a program to find the intersection and union of two unsorted arrays without using built-in functions.
3. Implement a sparse matrix multiplication algorithm using a 2D array in C#.
4. Write a method to find the first missing positive integer in an unsorted array (without sorting).
5. Design a method to rotate a 2D matrix (NxN) 90 degrees clockwise in place without using extra space.
